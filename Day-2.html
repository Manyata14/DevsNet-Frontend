<p style="font-weight: bold;">Subject: Request for new furniture for the common room</p>
<p>Respected Ma'am,</p>
<p>
I am writing this letter to request you for the new furniture in some of the classrooms along with the common room. It has been nearly 5 years (more/less) since we last ordered the new furniture and even since then the same furniture is used which is not even repaired once. Some of the chairs and tables are broken and many have nails coming out from their surface which has often resulted in the students' injury. In addition to this, the number of students in the new batch is quite large as compared to the previous one so this is another reason for the shortage of furniture.<br>
The following items need to be ordered:<br><br>
<table style="border: 2px solid black; width: 50%; border-collapse: collapse">
<tr style="border: 2px solid black;">
<th>S.No.</th>
<th>Item</th>
<th>Quantity</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1.</td>
<td>Teacher's Desk</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2.</td>
<td>Wooden Locker</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3.</td>
<td>Student Desk</td>
<td>50</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.</td>
<td>Library Desk</td>
<td>8</td>
</tr>
</table>
<br>
I request you to please accept my letter so I can place the order of the required number of furniture. You may contact me in case of any further queries. I would be very grateful to you. </p>
Yours sincerely,
<br>
Manyata Sharma
